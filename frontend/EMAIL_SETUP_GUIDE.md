# Email Setup Guide - Fix for Test Emails Not Working

## 🚨 Current Issue
The test emails are not working because the system is currently using **mock/logging mode** instead of sending real emails.

## ✅ What's Working Now
- ✅ Email preview dropdown is bigger and shows full content
- ✅ Email configuration is set up correctly
- ✅ Email content is being generated properly
- ✅ Console logging shows detailed email information

## 🔧 What's Not Working
- ❌ Actual email sending (emails are only logged to console)
- ❌ Real Gmail integration (needs proper setup)

## 📧 How to Fix Test Emails

### Option 1: Quick Fix - Check Console Logs (Current)
1. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Click "Draft Email"** on any lead
3. **Click "Send Email"** in the preview
4. **Check console logs** - you'll see detailed email information:
   ```
   📧 Sending test email...
   📧 From: rahulksanghvi21@gmail.com
   📧 To: hackohi00@gmail.com
   📧 Subject: Partnership Opportunity - [Business Name]
   📧 Body: [Full email content]
   ✅ Email details logged: [Complete email object]
   ```

### Option 2: Set Up Real Gmail Integration (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Google Cloud Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Gmail API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search for "Gmail API"
   - Click "Enable"

#### Step 2: Create OAuth2 Credentials
1. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Set application type to "Desktop application"
4. Download the credentials.json file
5. Place it in `HackOHIO/leads/app/agents/` directory

#### Step 3: Update Email Agent Configuration
1. Open `HackOHIO/leads/app/agents/email_agent.py`
2. Update line 15: `os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your-actual-api-key"`
3. Run the email agent to set up OAuth2 tokens

#### Step 4: Create API Endpoint
Create a new API endpoint in the leads service to call the email agent from the frontend.

### Option 3: Use Simple SMTP Service (Quick Setup)

#### Using Gmail SMTP
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password for your application
3. Update the email service to use SMTP sending

#### Using SendGrid/Mailgun
1. Sign up for SendGrid or Mailgun
2. Get API credentials
3. Update the email service configuration

## 🎯 Current Status Summary

### ✅ Working Features:
- **Email Preview**: Large dropdown showing full email content
- **Email Configuration**: Proper sender/receiver email setup
- **Email Generation**: Personalized email content based on lead data
- **Console Logging**: Detailed email information in browser console
- **UI/UX**: Proper loading states, success messages, error handling

### 🔧 What Needs to be Done:
- **Real Email Sending**: Currently only logging, need to implement actual sending
